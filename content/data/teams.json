As a current undergraduate student at UCLA, he is pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences/Mathematics. Hindered by his citizenship status, he has created opportunities for himself through his networking capabilities and his desire to learn. His status, his family, and friends motivate Juan to continue to pursue his goals and aspirations.
